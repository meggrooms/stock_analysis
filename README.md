# Stock Analysis of environmentally-friendly, "green", stocks

## Overview of Project

[https://github.com/meggrooms/stock_analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm]

Steve came to me in an effort to help his parents invest in cleaner & renewable energies. The analysis I created features refactored Microsoft VBA code to make it run more efficiently. Now that the script runs faster, we are better able to understand how these stocks fared in 2017 & 2018, guiding Steve in his recommendation of stocks that fit his parent's investment needs.

## Results

Below you'll see image 1 and image 2, which show just a snippet of differentces between the original and refactored code. The original code, image 1, contains a lot of loops that take time to process. Image 2 shows how the code can be refactored to hasten the processing time, which in turn decreases the environmental impact this analysis created. Image 3 presents the run times necessitated by the refactored code.

## Summary

### Pros and Cons of refactoring code.

 * Finding code that does what you want it to is easy, perhaps you've written some you are duplicating. Unnecessary code bogs down performance, however.
 * Refactoring a code may initially take some time, but it prepares the code to be more useful now and in the future.
 * A disadvantage of refactoring is the possiility of taking a code that works and making it unusable, in which case you need to start over.

**How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

For Steve's analysis, refactoring code had the double positive of reducing energy needed to run the macro (green!) and making the code easier to reuse in the future. I found that refactoring isn't as easy as it sounds, I drew a map to help visualize what I needed to do. I found this to be time consuming but in the end the script runs far more efficiently.
