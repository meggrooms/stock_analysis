# Stock Analysis of environmentally-friendly, "green", stocks

## Overview of Project

[https://github.com/meggrooms/stock_analysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm]

Steve came to me in an effort to help his parents invest in cleaner & renewable energies. The analysis I created features refactored Microsoft VBA code to make it run more efficiently. Now that the script runs faster, we are better able to understand how these stocks fared in 2017 & 2018, guiding Steve in his recommendation of stocks that fit his parent's investment needs.

## Results

Below you'll see image 1 and image 2, which show just a snippet of differentces between the original and refactored code. The original code, image 1, contains a lot of loops that take time to process. Image 2 shows how the code can be refactored to hasten the processing time, which in turn decreases the environmental impact this analysis created. Image 3 presents the run times necessitated by the refactored code.

## Summary

### Pros and Cons of refactoring code.

 * Finding code that does what you want it to is easy, perhaps you've written some you are duplicating. Unnecessary code bogs down performance, however.
 * Refactoring a code may initially take some time, but it prepares the code to be more useful now and in the future.
 * A disadvantage of refactoring is the possiility of taking a code that works and making it unusable

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

For Steve's analysis, refactoring code had the double positive of reducing energy needed to run the macro (green!) and making the code easier to reuse in the future. I found that refactoring isn't as easy as it sounds, I drew a map to help visualize what I needed to do. I found this to be time consuming but in the end the script runs far more efficiently.
